University Clustering: Private vs. Public Institutions
This project focuses on using clustering techniques to classify universities into two categories: private and public. By analyzing various attributes associated with universities,
such as tuition fees, enrollment numbers, location, and funding sources, we aim to develop a data-driven approach for distinguishing between private and public institutions.
"Approach
The project utilizes Python and several data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib) to perform exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and clustering. 
Through clustering analysis, we can reveal insights about the differences and similarities between private and public universities."
